# Lorenz-Model

This procedure solves the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations by means of the 4th order Runge Kutta method
and returns simulation videos as the equations are solved along time. This model, first studied by 
mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, constitutes a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection.
It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz
attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. 

More information about the execution of this procedure can be found in the documentation of the code.
